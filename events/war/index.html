                                            When the rep announces information, there are some things you will want to do
                                            if you want to be active in that war.  First, if you have weak armors, you
                                            will want to equip an armor that is strong against whatever the GM is wearing.
                                            Second, you may want to set a timer for frenzy.  The frenzy time will usually
                                            be announced as something like ":55 this hour", or ":15 next hour".  These
                                            mean that, for example, if it is currently 6:30 in your local time, that
                                            frenzy will occur at 6:55 or 7:15 respectively.  For more information on
                                            how frenzy works, please see <a href="#frenzy-info">frenzy info.</a>  Finally,
                                            make sure to not attack prior to frenzy.  The declare team will coordinate
                                            to make sure everything runs smoothly, but if someone attacks prior to frenzy
                                            it can cause issues with triggering it, losing points for both guilds.

                                            Frenzy is a part of wars in which everyone gains 20% extra points, allowing
                                            everyone to maximize their points.  Specifically the way frenzy works is
                                            that after there is 20 minutes left in the war, frenzy will trigger if the
                                            warring guilds come within about 10% of each other's points.  An example is,
                                            with 20 minutes left in a war, Guild A has 3000 points, and Guild B has 1500
                                            points.  The guild rep for Guild B attacks 2 times against the GM for 760
                                            points each time, giving Guild B 3020 points.  This results in frenzy
                                            triggering for 10 minutes following the second attack.

                                            When frenzy occurs, someone from the declare team will tag everyone in the
                                            war room, usually with "@All frenzy".  This is your cue to attack.  When you
                                            attack, attack the Guild Master (GM) with a <a href="#strip-setups">strip setup</a>
                                            to get max points.  The maximum points you can get during frenzy, without
                                            using a potion, is 912 per attack, so if you are getting less than that, you
                                            may need to fix your strip setup.  The best way to tell if you are getting max
                                            points is to look at the result of your attack, and if you are getting 500
                                            points for the attack, then you are getting max points.

                                                strip setup usually consists of 1 strong armor (UA, Exclusive, or something
                                                that is strong against the GM elements), and 2 Fusion Boost armors.

                                            Power attacking is an advanced strategy to get points fast, but only in
                                            very specific scenarios.  Normally, the Power Attack button uses 4 energy,
                                            but only gives you 3 attacks worth of points.  This means you would only get
                                            75% of the points by doing a power attack.  However, there are some situations
                                            where power attacking (also called PAing) can be useful.

                                            Imagine you have a Legendary II war potion.  This potion gives +40% points
                                            for 30 battles.  If you were to PA with this potion active, you would get

                                            <pre class="pt-3">(912 x 3) x 1.4 = 3830</pre>

                                            points per battle, for a total of

                                            <pre class="pt-3">3830 x 30 = 114900</pre>

                                            total points, costing 120 energy.  Now imagine this
                                            same scenario, but with regular attacks.  You attack 120 times, 30 of which
                                            you have the +40% boost active.  This results in the first 30 attacks getting

                                            <pre class="pt-3">912 x 1.4 = 1276</pre>

                                            points per attack, and the last 90 attacks getting 912 points per attack
                                            meaning a total of

                                            <pre class="pt-3">(1276 x 30) + (912 x 90) = 120360</pre>

                                            points.  In this case, it is not technically worth it to PA, but if we assume
                                            each attach takes ~5 seconds, this leads to a 4x time speedup, or the difference
                                            between attacking for 2.5 minutes by PAing, or the full 10 minutes of frenzy
                                            with normal attacks.  This would allow you to get more points over the course
                                            of the war.  Generally a good rule of thumb is that 45% or more potions are
                                            worth it to PA, 40% may be worth it if you are trying to be fast, and
                                            everything else should use regular attacks.
